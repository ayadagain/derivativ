00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,612
Let's look at the problem description.

2
00:00:02,716 --> 00:00:06,768
Here is a diagram of the right-angled triangle V M N.

3
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:09,063
The height V M is 11.

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:12,018
The base M N is 3.5.

5
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:15,513
The triangle V M N is right-angled at M.

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:19,520
By the Pythagorean Theorem, V N squared equals

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,044
V M squared plus M N squared.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,554
Substituting the values, V N squared

9
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:28,962
equals 11 squared plus 3.5 squared.

10
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:35,158
Calculating the squares, we get 121 plus 12.25.

11
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:40,686
So, V N squared equals 133.25.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,508
Taking the square root, V N is approximately 11.54.

13
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:53,116
Therefore, the hypotenuse V N is approximately 11.54 centimeters.

14
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:55,564
The calculation is complete.
